            Welcome to the NOEXC Balloon Project information landing site.
            NBP-3 will launch on June 27th during the
            <a href="https://www.arrl.org/field-day">ARRL Field Day</a> event.
            In addition to beaconing RTTY telemetry tracking-data, our payload
            will also include a 2-meter FM voice repeater which will enable
            all licensed amateur radio operators with access to 2-meters in the
            region to communicate amongst each other via the balloon.
            We welcome and encourage the community to track our efforts. We
            will publish more information as it is available. Please register
            on our <a href="https://noexc.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wiki</a> and our
            <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/noexc">
              mailing list
            </a> to track the latest developments within the project.

            <p>
              This flight (NBP-3) is a high-altitude balloon flight which will
              be launched by the
              <a href="https://noexc.org/">
                Northeast Ohio Experimenters Club
              </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of this flight is to enable amateur radio operators in
              the region of Ohio and possibly surrounding states to communicate
              with each other through the balloon.

            We will (may?) be live-streaming the launch of NBP-3. Once it is up
            in the air, you can track it in a number of ways. First, you can,
            of course, turn on a radio and decode the RTTY telemetry data using
            a computer or smartphone. If that's not an option, however, you can
            use our production "mapview" system which allows you to track the
            balloon in your browser from anywhere with an internet connection,
            in realtime. More information will appear here before the launch.
