            Hi there. NBP-1 is a test flight we are performing with the goal of
            testing our telemetry systems. We welcome the community to follow
            along in our efforts, but ask everyone to keep in mind that this is
            a test flight. Have fun and stay safe!

              This flight (NBP-1) is the first of hopefully many high-altitude
              balloon flights which will be launched by the
              <a href="https://noexc.org/">Northeast Ohio Experimenters Club</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The flight is meant to test our telemetry communication systems
              such as
              <a href="https://github.com/kg4sgp/arduino-rtty">arduino-rtty</a>,
              <a href="https://github.com/noexc/mapview">mapview</a>,
              <a href="https://github.com/noexc/mapview-psc">
                mapview's frontend
              </a>, and more. We will also be recording HD video from the
              payload and running a production mapview instance for the general
              public to use in tracking the balloon online.

            We will (may?) be live-streaming the launch of NBP-1. Once it is up
            in the air, you can track it in a number of ways. First, you can,
            of course, turn on a radio and decode the RTTY telemetry data using
            a computer or smartphone. If that's not an option, however, you can
            use our production "mapview" system which allows you to track the
            balloon in your browser from anywhere with an internet connection,
            in realtime. More information will appear here before the launch.
