          <p>
            Due to high winds and poorly placed trees, the launch failed. Upon
            release, the balloon drifted and rose, but did not clear a tree. The
            payload snagged and got caught in the tree.

            We appreciate all of your support, interest and encouragement.
            Please join us on our next launch.

            <p>
              As the name suggests, we (the University of Akron Amateur Radio
              Club), attempted to launch a 1200g balloon filled with hydrogen,
              into the sky.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through the use of amateur radio technologies and the Global
              Positioning System (GPS), we hoped to retrieve the payload at the
              end of the event.

              A group of friends who belong to the University of Akron Amateur
              Radio club was behind the High Altitude Balloon project.

            We live-streamed video of our launch and updated Twitter with status
            information. We will also sent our telemetry data to a website we
            have created, called MapView, which allowed you to track the path of
            the balloon from anywhere you had an internet connection.
